### Requirements

For local dev you'll require:

- Back-end:
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Front-end:
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

#### Back-end

The back-end consists of a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) powered Python application which exposes a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) API using [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/). Django is being used to deal with
authentication, and other various functions, and as such there are some views which are rendered from Django. You may think of Django renders the template which houses the front-end SPA.

#### Front-end

The front-end is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) powered Javascript application which uses [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) as a GraphQL client. When deployed in production this simply makes API calls to `/graphql` and benefits from the rest of the Django machinery.

**NOTE**: For local dev the **back-end** must be up and running as that is where the API (GraphQL server) runs (requests to
`/graphql` will fail otherwise!) Authentication is based on sessions with IDs stored on cookies, which will be on `localhost` in dev, this works fine as only the ports change between the two servers. Keep an eye out for issues pertaining to authentication as the default behaviour, at the moment, is to return a `302`, rediret to `/login`, which will present an error on the front-end console.

---

### Development

Clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:tsoporan/fittrak.git && cd fittrak
```

#### Back-end

The preferred way to bring up the stack is using Docker and `docker-compose`.
```bash
cd fittrak
# Bring up only the API to run migrations
docker-compose up
docker-compose run api python fittrak/manage.py migrate

# Create the first user (admin)
docker-compose run api python fittrak/manage.py createsuperuser
```
You can also run everything independently, which would require: `postgresql`, `python3.7` and `pipenv`.

With docker we can conveniently package these up and not worry about external deps.

**NOTE:** When running independently make sure you're aware of the env variables required (check `env.example` and set
`.env`), i.e:

There are two services that comprise the back-end: `api` and `fittrak_db`. `docker-compose up` brings
them all up though you may start each one with their respective `docker-compose up <service_name>`
command.

It is also useful to know how to work with `docker` and `docker-compose`, in general,  as you may need to rebuild
and interact with containers during dev.

#### Front-end

Using `npm`:

```
cd fittrak-client && npm install

export VUE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/graphql

npm run serve
```

#### Migrations

To apply DB migrations we can run a command in the container:

- `docker-compose run api python fittrak/manage.py makemigrations`
- `docker-compose run api python fittrak/manage.py migrate`

#### Tests

Tests can be run with the usual:

- `docker-compose run api python fittrak/manage.py test`

---

### Deployment

Firstly check how the app behaves in production mode:
```bash

# Build production bundle

cd fittrak-client
NODE_ENV=production npm run build

# This will dump the assets in ../fittrak/assets which will be picked up
# by the "render_bundle" template tag in Django

# Set DEBUG to "False" in docker-compose
docker-compose up

# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

The application currently sits on a [GCP VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute) and uses [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) (PostgreSQL 9.6). SSL is through [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and the Nginx [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuartful-nginx.html)

Future plans may include IaC, and moving to a more robust container solution, such as k8s, though it's fairly overkill at the moment.
